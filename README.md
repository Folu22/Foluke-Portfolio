# Foluke-Portfolio
This Portfolio contains various Python project done by me.

## Contents
* ### Python Project
1. **[Tasty Bytes Recipe Project](https://github.com/Folu22/Foluke-Portfolio/blob/main/Datacamp%20Professional%20Recipe%20Prediction.ipynb)**
    * Predicted the receipe that will generate high traffic into tasty bytes website by 80%.
    * Perform Explorative Data Analysis to have a better understanding of the data.
    * Imputed missing values using various methods.
    * Used KNN nad XGB model to predict the data and I choose XGB model because it performed better.
    * Used precision score to evaluate the metrics of the model.

2. **[House Price Prediction project](https://github.com/Folu22/Foluke-Portfolio/blob/main/house%20price%20prediction.ipynb)**
   * Predicted house prices at Melbourne state capital which is the most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria.
   * Explained each features in the dataset.
   * Performed data cleaning and validation.
   * Perform Explorative Data Analysis to have a better understanding of the data.
   * Performed feature engineering
   * Used linear regression, decision tree and random forese=t model to predict the dataset and I choose random forest model because it performed better than others.
   * Used Root Mean Squared Error to evalute the metrics of the models.
  
3. **[Dehli Weather Prediction project](https://github.com/Folu22/Foluke-Portfolio/blob/main/house%20price%20prediction.ipynb)**
   * Forecasted Dehli weather condition.
   * Performed data cleaning and validation.
   * Perform Explorative Data Analysis to have a better understanding of the data.
   * Used linear regression and time series predicition model which is ARIMA to forecast the model.
  
4. **[Health Insurance Prediction project](https://github.com/Folu22/Foluke-Portfolio/blob/main/health_ins_premium_classification_problem.ipynb)**
   * Predicted if a customer (policy holder) will pay next premium or not.
   * Explained each features in the dataset.
   * Performed data cleaning and validation.
   * Perform Explorative Data Analysis to have a better understanding of the data.
   * Performed feature engineering
   * Used knn and decision tree  model to predict the dataset and I choose decison tree model because it performed better than other.
   * Used accuracy score to evalute the metrics of the models.
